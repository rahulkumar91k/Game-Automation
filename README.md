# Game-Automation


Creating an automated Hill Climb Racing game using Python, Mediapipe, OpenCV, and machine learning is an exciting project that combines computer vision and artificial intelligence to enhance the gaming experience. This project involves using a webcam or camera to capture real-time video of a player's hand gestures, which are then processed by OpenCV for hand tracking and Mediapipe for pose estimation. Through this, the player can control the in-game character's movements by tilting or moving their hand in various directions. Machine learning algorithms can be employed to interpret these hand gestures and translate them into specific game commands, such as accelerating, braking, or steering. By training a model with labeled hand gesture data, the game can learn to recognize and respond to the player's movements, making it an interactive and immersive gaming experience. This fusion of computer vision, machine learning, and the popular Hill Climb Racing game offers a unique and engaging way to play, showcasing the potential of AI and gesture-based control in gaming.

Key Components:

Mediapipe: Mediapipe is a framework developed by Google that provides various pre-trained machine learning models for tasks like hand tracking, pose estimation, and facial recognition. In this project, you can use Mediapipe to track the player's hand movements and gestures.

OpenCV: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a versatile library for computer vision tasks. You can use OpenCV to capture and process the game's screen, extract relevant information, and simulate user input (e.g., touchscreen taps).

Project Workflow:

Game Capture: Use OpenCV to capture the screen while the game is running. You can do this by taking screenshots or recording the screen.

Hand Detection: Employ Mediapipe's hand tracking model to detect the player's hand in each frame. This will allow you to track hand movements and gestures.

Gesture Recognition: Implement a gesture recognition system using machine learning techniques. You can train a model to recognize specific hand gestures, such as tapping, swiping, or pinching, to control the game.

Game Control: Simulate touch events or keyboard inputs based on the detected hand gestures. For example, if the bot detects a "tap" gesture, it should simulate a tap at the appropriate position on the game screen.

Decision-Making: Use machine learning or computer vision algorithms to analyze the game screen and make strategic decisions. For example, the bot can identify obstacles and adjust the vehicle's actions (acceleration, braking, and steering) to overcome challenges.

Feedback Loop: Continuously capture and analyze the game's screen, update the bot's decisions, and control the game in real-time.
